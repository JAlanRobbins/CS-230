# CS-230 - Final Journal


//Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

    The Gaming Room was a client with a request to develop an infrastructure for their game, Draw It or Lose It, that could be expanded from their original design on
    Android to other Operating systems. The design was then implemented so that it would it functional from a web browser as well as a mobile app

//What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
    
    I believe that one of my better explanations in the documentation was laying down options for the development of the code. I think that through the 
    developmental life of the project that having options open to you is incredibly important to stay flexible. If one solution does not work, then it 
    is better that you already have options laid out before you than having to come up with a new solution on the fly.
    
//What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

    I think that the design document helped keep the overall goal of the project in mind while writing the code. I was able to look back and reference 
    certain specifications and goals of the build while writing and it helped me stay on task and think about what needed to be done next.

//If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

    I think if I had to go back and change anything it would be my initial domain model for the project, which was vastly different from my final realization
    I learned just how complex and interconnected all the facets of a web server could be and it definitely made me want to study up on the topic.

//How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
    
    How I interpreted the design was that it needed to be something lightweight, something that could run easily in a browser, a low spec system or even 
    on a smartphone. I came to that conclusion because of how the client wanted to basically expand their player base to as many people as possible. It's
    important to consider the needs of your user because ultimately the user is the one that will run your code the most and see the most flaws in it. It's
    also a point of pride to have anyone enjoy the work that you produce.
    
//How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

    My approach to designing the software was to analyze the needs of the client while still trying to make the software as streamlined as possible. I thought
    of how the user would interface with the software and tried to research all of the available tools that I could use to help make the user experience as 
    simple as possible while ensuring high performance. Research is definitely needed in order to know all the tools at your disposal when it comes to web 
    servers and creating an application around it.
